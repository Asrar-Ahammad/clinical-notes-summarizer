### Chief Complaint
"I've been feeling short of breath lately, especially when I walk up the stairs, and my ankles are looking swollen."

### History of Present Illness (HPI)
Mr. John Smith is a 60-year-old male with a significant history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes who presents with a 2-week history of progressive dyspnea on exertion. He reports that he can no longer walk a full block without stopping to rest. He also describes orthopnea, requiring three pillows to sleep comfortably at night, and occasional paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND). He denies any chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. He has noticed bilateral lower extremity edema that has worsened over the last few days. He reports a weight gain of approximately 8 pounds in the last week. He denies fever, chills, or cough.

### Past Medical History (PMH)
- **Hypertension:** Diagnosed 15 years ago, currently managed with Lisinopril.
- **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus:** Diagnosed 10 years ago, A1c was 7.4% at the last visit.
- **Hyperlipidemia:** Managed with Atorvastatin.
- **Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA):** Uses CPAP at night (reports good compliance).

### Medications
- Lisinopril 20mg daily
- Metformin 1000mg twice daily
- Atorvastatin 40mg daily
- Aspirin 81mg daily
- Multivitamin daily

### Allergies
- **Penicillin:** Hives/Rash.
- **Sulfa Drugs:** Nausea.

### Social History
- **Tobacco:** Former smoker, quit 10 years ago (30 pack-year history).
- **Alcohol:** Occasional social drinking, 1-2 beers on weekends.
- **Occupation:** Retired accountant.
- **Living situation:** Lives with his wife in a two-story home.

### Physical Examination
- **Vitals:** BP: 152/94 mmHg, HR: 88 bpm (regular), RR: 22/min, SpO2: 93% on room air, Temp: 98.6°F, Weight: 215 lbs.
- **General:** Pleasant male in mild respiratory distress, speaking in full sentences but pausing frequently.
- **HEENT:** Normocephalic, atraumatic. No jugular venous distention (JVD) noted initially, but becomes apparent at 45 degrees (estimated at 10 cm H2O).
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm. S1 and S2 present. A faint S3 gallop is heard at the apex. No murmurs or rubs.
- **Pulmonary:** Bibasilar crackles (rales) extending approximately 1/3 up the lung fields. Increased work of breathing noted.
- **Abdomen:** Soft, non-tender, non-distended. No hepatomegaly.
- **Extremities:** 2+ pitting edema to the mid-calf bilaterally. Warm to touch. Capillary refill < 2 seconds.
- **Neurological:** Alert and oriented x3. Cranial nerves II-XII intact.

### Assessment and Plan
**1. New Onset Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):** Likely systolic dysfunction given the clinical presentation of DOE, PND, orthopnea, S3 gallop, and peripheral edema.
   - **Action:** Admit to observation for diuresis.
   - **Orders:** Start Furosemide (Lasix) 40mg IV BID. Monitor strict I/Os and daily weights.
   - **Diagnostics:** Order 12-lead EKG, Chest X-ray (PA/Lateral), and transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF).
   - **Labs:** CBC, CMP, BNP (Brain Natriuretic Peptide), and Troponin I.

**2. Hypertension (HTN):** Suboptimally controlled, likely exacerbated by fluid overload.
   - **Action:** Continue current Lisinopril for now. Will adjust once volume status is stabilized.

**3. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM):** Stable.
   - **Action:** Continue Metformin. Monitor blood glucose QID while hospitalized.

**4. Disposition:** Patient will be monitored for response to IV diuretics. Goal is to reach euvolemia before discharge and establish a follow-up with Cardiology within 1 week.
